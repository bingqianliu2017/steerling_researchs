# Steerling-8B:

**An interpretable causal diffusion language model with concept steering.**

Steerling-8B is an 8 billion parameter language model that combines masked diffusion with interpretable concept decomposition. Unlike standard autoregressive LLMs, Steerling generates text by iteratively unmasking tokens in order of confidence, and decomposes its internal representations into human-interpretable concepts that can be inspected and steered.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install steerling
```

```python
from steerling import SteerlingGenerator, GenerationConfig

generator = SteerlingGenerator.from_pretrained("guidelabs/steerling-8b")

text = generator.generate(
    "The key to understanding neural networks is",
    GenerationConfig(max_new_tokens=100, seed=42),
)
print(text)
```

## Architecture

Steerling uses block-causal attention, bidirectional within a block, and causal across blocks. The interpretable concept heads decompose transformer hidden states into:

```
hidden → known_features + unknown_features + epsilon = composed → logits
```

- **known_features**: Weighted sum of top-k learned concept embeddings (interpretable and maps to understandable features)
- **unknown_features**: Residual captured by a factorized unknown head (101,196 concepts, rank 256)
- **epsilon**: Small correction for reconstruction fidelity
